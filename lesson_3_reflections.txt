1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans: If the repository needs to be shared by other developers then I would push the code to remote repository.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans: Some users might not need all the code(data) in their local machine because they might not be working on it.
So it is better if the user has choice to pull data from remote repository rather than making it automatic.
