1. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Ans: I don't have to search through the old files because I get them all at one place. 

2. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros: We can avoid some trivial commits by manually choosing.
Cons: We may miss important commits if they're too large.

3. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Ans: Version control systems have code files which are interrelated(change in one file may affect the other).
So they allow saving multiple files in one commit. But Google docs treat each file separately because we use
it to save regualr text files that are not connected to other files.

4. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Ans: "git log" is used to get all the recent commits done and "git diff" is used to see the changes made between two different commits.

5. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Ans: Because I could get the old versions of the code using "git checkout", I can be confident enough to make a change.

6. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Ans: I want to use Git in my projects when ever I make changes in the code.
